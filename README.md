UnderStrap Wordpress Theme Framework
===
Basically I like the _s Wordpress Starter Theme from Automattic and the grid Framework Bootstrap. Additionally I´am a huge SASS/COMPASS fan. Why don´t combine all these three things into a solid Wordpress Theme Framework?
That´s what UnderStrap is (or will be...)

At the moment UnderStrap is in a very early stage. But if you wan´t feel free to use it for your own Wordpress theme!

Some features
=
- Combines the _s Wordpress Starter Theme and Bootstrap
- Comes with Bootstrap SASS source files and additonal scss files. Nicely sorted and ready to add your own variables/customize the Bootstrap variables.
- Uses a single and minified CSS file 
- Font Awesome Icon Font integrated
- Simple RTL file
- Jetpack ready
- Child Theme ready (A basic starter Child Theme will be released in the future as a separate Repository)
- Translation ready
